=== What? ===

Have a PS/2 keyboard, but your brand new computer only supports USB?
Your PS/2-to-USB converter does its job only half-hearted?
Or do you have a keyboard never intended to work on a PC or Mac, but still want
to use it?

Then Keyboard Upgrade is for you! Build your own USB keyboard controller and
let the free Keyboard Upgrade firmware blow some life into it!

This open source firmware was designed for use on homebrew keyboard controllers
based on Atmel AVR microcontrollers--in particular, the ATMEGA series.
Currently, these keyboards are supported:

- IBM Model M
- IBM Model M Mini
- IBM M4-1 (without trackpoint)

Schematics are included. Support for new controller designs can be added fairly
easily by re-using a common set of source code files.
