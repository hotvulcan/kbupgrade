This is the firmware for IBM Model M keyboards. It has been tested with a
1391401, but may also work with other, similar IBM models.

Suitable PCBs:
- RUMP by Chris Lee (see http://mg8.org/rump/)
- Dulcimer by Ronald Schaten (see http://www.schatenseite.de/dulcimer.html)

Notes:
- When using RUMP, you may want to add three resistors and a 4-pin connector
  for the LEDs (see the Dulcimer PCB on how to connect).
- If you have a Model M Mini (aka Space Saver), consider using the firmware in
  the 1392934 directory instead.
