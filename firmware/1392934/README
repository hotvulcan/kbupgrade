This is the firmware for IBM Model M Mini keyboards. It has been tested with a
1391472 and a 1392934.

Suitable PCBs:
- RUMP by Chris Lee (see http://mg8.org/rump/)
- Dulcimer by Ronald Schaten (see http://www.schatenseite.de/dulcimer.html)

Notes:
- Using this firmware instead of the version for the full-size version is
  advantageous because (1) the keyboard layout is sparser than on the full-size
  version, resulting in fewer chances for ghost keys; and (2) it gives you
  three more free I/O pins on the microcontroller (pins 18, 19, and 20) because
  there are no LEDs on the keyboard.
- If you plan to add LEDs to your Space Saver, consider using the firmware for
  the full-size version for a start. Adding LED support to the the version in
  this directory, however, is trivial and can be implemented upon request.
  Please contact the package author if you want this.
