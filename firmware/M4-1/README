This is the firmware for IBM M4-1 keyboards. It also works on the Unicomp
versions, at least on those with a blue IBM logo (tested on a 84G2524 model
from 1999).

Suitable PCBs:
- Circuit is included.

Notes:
- The circuit does not support the trackpoint yet, but is prepared to do so in
  the future. For this reason, port A on the ATMEGA is not utilized since the
  pins on this port can be configured as inputs for the ATMEGA's A/D
  converters.
- For an M4 (the one without the trackpoint) it should be possible to make a
  specialized version that does not attempt to use the trackpoint and mouse
  buttons. The circuit for that model would be a bit simpler since the pins
  used for trackpoint axes and mouse buttons could be used for the keyboard
  rows. This saves one shift register and 8 diodes (not much saved in terms of
  money, but in terms of PCB space).
