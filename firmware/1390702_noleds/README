This is the firmware for IBM Model M 122-key terminal keyboards such as the IBM
1390702. Since the 1390702 does not have LEDs, there is no support for LEDs in
this firmware. There is another version with LED support, but the circuit for
that one is a bit more complicated.

Suitable PCBs:
- Circuits are included (circuits/IBM_Model_M_122_keys/simple.pdf).
