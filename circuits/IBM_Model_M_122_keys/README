There are two circuit designs for IBM Model M 122-key terminal keyboards
in this directory: one with LED support (schematic.pdf), and a simpler
circuit without LEDs (simple.pdf).

If your terminal keyboards does not have LEDs and you are not planning to
add some, it is recommended to stick with the simpler design, which is
also a bit cheaper than the LED-enabled version.

Jumper KM0 is on PD7 (pin 21) in the version with LED support, and on
PD3 (pin 17) in the simplified version.

Thanks to Specter_57 for providing the keyboard matrix information.
