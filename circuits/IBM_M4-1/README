This is a circuit design for an IBM M4-1 keyboard (made with KiCad).

There are at least two different versions of the original PCB. Their dimensions
are very similar, but otherwise they are quite different. The problem is that
they have different connectors for attaching the keyboard matrix, LEDs, and
mouse buttons to the board, so you need to check your keyboard before building
the replacement PCB.

One version has a 19-pin connector and a 9-pin connector for the keyboard
matrix, plus a separate 4-pin connector for the LEDs, and another 4-pin
connecter for connecting the mouse buttons (only three traces used). Such a PCB
was found inside a 1379590 made by Lexmark (1994).

The other version has a 22-pin connector and a 13-pin connector for the
keyboard matrix. Three of the traces on the 22-pin connector are used for the
two mouse buttons and their GND, and four traces on the 13-pin connector are
used for the LEDs and their common GND (or +5V?). The PCB was found inside a
84G2524 made by Unicomp (1999), which also had an unused 4-pin connector
(mounted in the same place as the one for the mouse buttons on the Lexmark
model).

Jumper KM0 is on PD3 (pin 17).


Confirmed to work with the following keyboard models:

- 1379590 (Lexmark 1994)
- 84G2524 (Unicomp 1999)
