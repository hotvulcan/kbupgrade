If you checked out these sources from Github, then no configure script
or Makefiles will be available.

This is by intention!

These file are generated and must never be checked into any version
control system. To build a configure script, you'll need to install
recent versions of GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake, preferably the
latest stable versions available.

Then, simply run

$ autoreconf -i

in order to build the configure script and various Makefile.in files.
